# Task list

Work in this project is tracked as tasks. One file per task. The folder a task sits
in is its state:

| folder | meaning |
|---|---|
| `open/` | being worked on now (status `in_progress` = the active one), or waiting to be picked up (`open`) |
| `pending_review/` | finished, waiting for a human to check it |
| `closed/` | done and signed off |
| `archive/` | dropped, or rolled into another task |

There's no app and no database — the folder is the board, and `git` is the history.

Manage tasks with the tool (don't move files by hand):

```
node ~/.claude/task-system/task.js list             # open tasks + what's active (* = in_progress)
node ~/.claude/task-system/task.js new "title" --files src/x.py --docs src/README.md
node ~/.claude/task-system/task.js start <id>       # make an open task the active (in_progress) one
node ~/.claude/task-system/task.js move <id> pending_review
node ~/.claude/task-system/task.js move <id> closed   # refused until receipts are filled
```

**Two frontmatter fields the hooks enforce — `files:` and `docs:`** (YAML lists of
repo-relative paths). They link a task to the code it owns *and* the documentation that
code lives under, so neither is forgotten:

- **`files:`** — the code/test files this task touches. The PreToolUse task-gate
  (`~/.claude/scripts/hooks/task-gate.js`) blocks a 2nd+ code write that isn't matched by
  the single in_progress task's `files:` globs. If the work grows, add the new file here.
- **`docs:`** — the README(s)/docs that document this task's code. The Stop completion-gate
  (`~/.claude/scripts/hooks/task-complete-gate.js`) **blocks session end** when a
  code-changing in_progress task either declares no `docs:`, or declares docs that weren't
  updated **this session** (a SessionStart hook, `docs-snapshot.js`, baselines the working
  tree so a doc merely dirty from earlier work doesn't count). Satisfy it by editing the
  listed docs this session, or write a one-line `docs n/a: <reason>`.

The same completion-gate also enforces a **tests floor**: when code changed, a test must have
been added/updated this session (any `tests/` path, or `test_*` / `_test` / `*.spec` / `*.test`
naming), or you write a one-line `tests n/a: <reason>` (rename/comment/pure-doc). The gate only
proves a test was *touched* — the **rigour** is on you (see "Testing standard" below).

A non-blocking Stop reminder (`deps-surface.js`) also lists, for each changed `.py`, the
modules that import it — the dependents you may need to update too.

## Testing standard

The gate checks that a test exists; this section is how you make it a test that would actually
catch a bug. Two failure modes to avoid: **incomplete** (you forgot the empty-input case) and
**tautological** (the test passes no matter what the code does). Different fixes:

**Completeness — walk two checklists.** Don't enumerate hundreds of inputs; test one representative
per *class of behaviour* (equivalence partitioning) plus the *boundaries* between classes.

- **Right-BICEP** — *what* to test: **R**ight (correct result on a known input), **B**oundary
  conditions, **I**nverse (round-trip: `decode(encode(x)) == x`), **C**ross-check (agree with a
  simpler/reference implementation), **E**rror conditions (bad input → the right raise),
  **P**erformance (only when it matters).
- **CORRECT** — *which boundaries*: **C**onformance (shape/format), **O**rdering, **R**ange (values
  in bounds — an invariant), **R**eference (external state; **does it mutate its input?**),
  **E**xistence (null / empty / zero), **C**ardinality (the 0-1-many rule), **T**ime
  (ordering/timeouts/concurrency).

Walk the rows, keep the ones that apply, say why. A pure numeric transform usually earns 4–8 tests
(a couple of happy representatives + empty/one/constant/zero boundaries + one per error path), not
one per row and not one per input.

**Rigour — prove the test is load-bearing.** One of:

1. **Red-first** — write the test (or confirm it) *failing* before the code exists / the fix lands.
   A test you've watched fail for the right reason is proven to bite.
2. **Independent review** — a second pass (person or agent) asks: *"would this test still pass if the
   function returned its input unchanged / returned zeros / was a no-op?"* If yes, it's tautological.
3. **Mutation check** (for load-bearing logic) — flip a `>` to `>=`, a `+` to `-`; the tests must go
   red. The objective measure that a test catches bugs.

**Type/return correctness is not a test's job** — assert it with static typing (mypy/pyright), which
checks every path for free. Reserve tests for *behaviour*: values, shapes, invariants, and raises.

**Golden master** (freeze a whole output and compare) is the far end of "Right" — reach for it only
when the output is too rich to assert any other way (arrays, images, rendered docs), and keep a
tolerance so float noise doesn't false-fail. Prefer a narrow property/threshold when one exists.

Each task file opens with an **In plain English** section — 2–5 sentences a reader with no
project context can follow (what is the objective, and how will it be done? — no acronyms, no
file paths). The completion gate blocks a code-changing session while it is missing or unfilled;
`task.js start` scaffolds it into older files. The rest of the file is the engineering record:
**What** we're doing, **Why**, **How** (lead with a **Reuse evidence** table — one row per
"this already exists" claim, each with a `file:line` in the Evidence column), an
**Invariants and recovery** section for stateful/HIGH work (or `invariants n/a: <reason>`),
how we'll **Verify** it, and a **Receipts** table filled in when it closes.

Before starting a HIGH task, run the plan checks while the plan is still cheap to change:
`node ~/.claude/scripts/task-plan-lint.js <task-file>` (deterministic scope gaps), then the
**plan-reviewer** agent (fresh context, reads the actual code, hunts for a plan claim the
code contradicts).
