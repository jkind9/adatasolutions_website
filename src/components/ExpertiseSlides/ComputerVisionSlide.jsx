    `Our computer vision practice delivers bespoke image and video analytics solutions that solve real-world challenges across industries. 
    Leveraging OpenCV, YOLOv5, and custom deep-learning architectures, we build systems that automatically extract and quantify visual informationâ€”such as symbol counting on construction sites, thermal imaging for quality control, and facial recognition for access management.`,
    `Credited as lead inventor in a novel take-off/estimation platform,our clients can now reduce manual labor by an order of magnitude. 
    From prototype to deployment in Docker-based pipelines or embedded devices, we handle every stage: data collection, annotation, model training, and continuous improvement.`
